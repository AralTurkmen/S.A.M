The 128x64 OLED project uses, as the name states a 0.96-inch I2C OLED display with 128 x 64 pixels connected to a NTP clock through 2.4GHz WIFI.

TODO:
- The clock interface will be updated to only include hour and minute to lower battery consumption, and make space for larger text size.
- The code will be updated to store more wifi combinations for 

INDEX:
- Code: Contains the running code.
- Design: Contains the sliced 3D file together with photos of the finished construction.
- References: Contains reference documents used during development.

Parts:
- Microcontroller: LOLIN D1 mini V4.0.0 4MB ESP-8266EX based
- 2xAA battery holder
- 128x64 OLED display
- Custom 3D printed shell
- I2C cable

Assembly Instructions:
1. Solder the I2C cable to its corresponding pins on the display.
2. Solder the battery ground cable to the GND pin and positive cable to the 3v3 pin (Make sure the cables run back towards the WIFI antenna before soldering).
3. Tape the microcontroller facing slightly right, freeing up space for the I2C cable and then connect the I2C cable.
4. Tape the screen onto the inside of the top cover (the screen will fit into the cutout with some wiggling).
5. Tape around the mouth of the shell so that the top cover fits snugly and won't loosen by itself.
OBS: No schematics were made due to the simplicity of the system.
